# **Dodgemaul Rules**
#### 1. Build is naked with two mauls, remaining 6 build points can go to perks.
#### 2. Mauls are to be thrown ONLY, a thrown maul must be dodged, not parried.
#### 3. The field of play is cut in half, Mauls are only to be thrown from your side
#### 4. Boxing is allowed and you can block with fists (Maul parries/swings are still never allowed)
#### 5. Kicks are allowed
# Royal Decree(s)
### Use of enchanted constructs known as 'hacks' or 'cheats' is strictly forbidden. (Except for the ragdoll exploit - that one's just too amusing!)
### Unless its the ragdol exploit, thats too funny!
#### Please all check out my other server "FLAK's Duels & Dungeon"
